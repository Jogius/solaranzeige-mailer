# solaranzeige-mailer
A python program that reads data from a solaranzeige influxdb and sends an email if certain conditions are met

## Disclaimer
This script is can be used with a software called [solaranzeige](https://solaranzeige.de). However, it was created for my personal use and is not actively maintained, so compatibility with newer versions of solaranzeige is likely but not promised.

## Configuration
To configure the script, simply copy the ``.env.example`` file to ``.env`` and replace the values with your own.
